# 4. âœ… Create a GET (All) Route
    # 4.1 Make a `get` method that takes `self` as a param.
    # 4.2 Create a `songs` array.
    # 4.3 Make a query for all songs. For each `song`, create a dictionary 
    # containing all attributes before appending to the `songs` array.
    # 4.4 Create a `response` variable and set it to: 
    #  make_response(
    #       jsonify(songs),
    #       200
    #  )
    # 4.5 Return `response`.
    # 4.6 After building the route, run the server and test in the browser.
  
# 5. âœ… Serialization
    # This is great, but there's a cleaner way to do this! Serialization will allow us to easily add our 
    # associations as well.
    # Navigate to `models.py` for Steps 6 - 9.

# 10. âœ… Use our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
    # 10.1 Query all of the songs, convert them to a dictionary with `to_dict` before setting them to a list.
    # 10.2 Invoke `make_response`, pass it the song list along with a status of 200. Set `make_response` to a 
    # `response` variable.
    # 10.3 Return the `response` variable.
    # 10.4 After building the route, run the server and test your results in the browser.
 
# 11. âœ… Create a POST Route
    # Prepare a POST request in Postman. Under the `Body` tab, select `form-data` and fill out the body 
    # of a song request. 
    
    # Create the POST route 
    # ðŸ“š Review With Students: request object
    
    # 11.1 Create a `post` method and pass it `self`.
    # 11.2 Create a new song from the `request.form` object.
    # 11.3 Add and commit the new song.
    # 11.4 Convert the new song to a dictionary with `to_dict`
    # 11.5 Set `make_response` to a `response` variable and pass it the new song along with a status of 201.
    # 11.6 Test the route in Postman.

   
# 12. âœ… Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`

# 13. âœ… Create a GET (One) route
    # 13.1 Build a class called `songByID` that inherits from `Resource`.
    # 13.2 Create a `get` method and pass it the id along with `self`. (This is how we will gain access to 
    # the id from our request)
    # 13.3 Make a query for our song by the `id` and build a `response` to send to the browser.


# 14. âœ… Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`
