# 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
# If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
# If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
# In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

# in Global Scope.

# 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors.
# If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
# pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
# pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"

    except SyntaxError:
